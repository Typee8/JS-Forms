## :mortar_board: Acquired skills:

:white_check_mark: Separation of Concerns (SOC): Implemented smaller functions to perform specific tasks, enhancing code maintainability and readability.<br>
:white_check_mark: File Handling: Used the 'FileReader' object for processing of file data.<br>
:white_check_mark: Regular Expressions: Employed regular expressions (Regex) for data validation.<br>
:white_check_mark: CSV Parsing: Found pattern to divide parts of data from the .csv file.<br>
:white_check_mark: Custom Events: Utilized custom events to automatically trigger the display of data after completion of .csv file reading. (I didn't know how to handle async operations back then.)<br>
:white_check_mark: HTML Structure Prototyping: Created HTML prototypes to simplify development in JS.<br>
